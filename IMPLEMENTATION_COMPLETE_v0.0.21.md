# 🎉 Streamer Item Management - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What Was Built

I've successfully implemented **comprehensive item management** for broadcasters in your Twitch extension. This allows streamers to:

1. **Accept/Reject Viewer Suggestions** - View pending suggestions and add approved ones to the tier list
2. **Add Items Dynamically** - Add new items to active tier lists on-the-fly
3. **Edit Items** - Modify item names and images with inline editing
4. **Delete Items** - Remove items and their associated votes with safety confirmations

## 📦 Files Created/Modified

### Backend Changes
- ✅ `backend/src/routes/tierListRoutes.ts` - Added 3 new endpoints:
  - `POST /api/tierlists/:id/items` - Add item to tier list
  - `PUT /api/tierlists/:id/items/:itemId` - Update item details  
  - `DELETE /api/tierlists/:id/items/:itemId` - Remove item (also removes votes)

### Frontend Changes
- ✅ `frontend/src/utils/api.ts` - Added 3 API methods:
  - `addItemToTierList()`
  - `updateTierListItem()`
  - `removeItemFromTierList()`
